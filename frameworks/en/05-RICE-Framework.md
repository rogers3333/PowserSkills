# RICE Framework

> Source: [Juuzt AI - RICE Framework](https://juuzt.ai/knowledge-base/prompt-frameworks/the-rice-framework/)

## Framework Overview

The RICE Framework is a powerful prioritization tool that brings clarity and precision to decision-making in AI prompt engineering. By evaluating options through four core components—Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort—this framework enables users to identify high-value opportunities with minimal resources.

## Four Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reach** | Measure how many people or systems will benefit from the change |
| **Impact** | Assess the potential value or improvement the change will bring |
| **Confidence** | Evaluate how certain you are that the idea will succeed |
| **Effort** | Estimate the resources (time, money, manpower) required |

### RICE Score Formula

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```
