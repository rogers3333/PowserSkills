# CRISPE Framework

> Source: [Juuzt AI - CRISPE Framework](https://juuzt.ai/knowledge-base/prompt-frameworks/the-crispe-framework/)

## Framework Overview

The CRISPE Framework (Clarity, Relevance, Iteration, Specificity, Parameters, Examples) is a groundbreaking methodology for designing AI prompts that achieve maximum precision and relevance. By blending clarity with iterative refinement, CRISPE ensures that every interaction with large language models delivers impactful and actionable outputs.

## Six Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clarity** | Clearly define the task or goal to minimize ambiguity |
| **Relevance** | Focus on aligning the prompt with the context or audience for accurate results |
| **Iteration** | Incorporate iterative improvements by refining responses based on feedback |
| **Specificity** | Add precise details or constraints to narrow the AI's focus |
| **Practicality** | Ensure that the output is actionable and feasible for implementation |
| **Examples** | Provide sample inputs or outputs to guide the AI towards the desired outcome |
