# RACEF Framework

> Source: [Juuzt AI - RACEF Framework](https://juuzt.ai/knowledge-base/prompt-frameworks/the-racef-framework/)

## Framework Overview

The RACEF Framework (Rephrase, Append, Contextualize, Examples, Follow-Up) represents a cutting-edge methodology in AI prompt engineering. Designed to maximize the effectiveness of interactions with large language models (LLMs), RACEF provides a structured, dynamic approach to crafting precise prompts.

## Five Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rephrase** | Refine the wording of your query to achieve more precise and relevant results |
| **Append** | Add details or constraints to guide the AI towards targeted outputs |
| **Contextualize** | Provide background information or situational details to align the AI's responses with your needs |
| **Examples** | Include sample inputs or desired outputs to clarify expectations |
| **Follow-Up** | Encourage iterative improvement by allowing the AI to ask questions or refine its responses |
