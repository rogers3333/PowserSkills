## Framework Overview

The BAB Framework (Before, After, Bridge) was originally designed as a copywriting formula and has been successfully adapted for AI prompt engineering. Like PAS (Pain, Agitate, Solution) and AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), BAB was created to structure persuasive text but has found new life in guiding AI models to deliver precise and impactful responses.

Its emphasis on storytelling and emotional resonance makes it an ideal tool for crafting prompts that connect user needs with actionable solutions.
